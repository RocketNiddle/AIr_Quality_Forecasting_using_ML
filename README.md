"# Air_Quality_Forecasting_using_ML" 
Have you ever wondered what drives the changes in the air we breathe? During Air Quality Awareness Week, I embarked on a fascinating journey to uncover the patterns and trends in air pollution through a comprehensive Air Quality Forecasting project. Here’s a glimpse into what I discovered:

🔍 Project Highlights:

Data Loading: Imported and cleaned the dataset to ensure accuracy.
Data Preprocessing: Removed unnecessary columns, addressed missing values, and converted date formats for better analysis.
Data Transformation: Leveraged lambda functions to replace and modify values efficiently.
Data Integration: Merged multiple series into a single pandas DataFrame for seamless processing.
Model Training: Employed the powerful Prophet model for precise forecasting.
Model Fitting & Prediction: Fit the model to the data, generated predictions, and created detailed forecasts.
Visualization: Crafted insightful plots to visualize trends, and weekly and daily patterns.
📊 Results:

Developed a robust model that can predict air quality trends with impressive accuracy.
Visualized key components to reveal intriguing seasonal patterns and trends in air qualit
